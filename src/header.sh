# ADDING A TYPE — the absent-vs-zero contract for every TYPE_* map below.
# These maps are read under `set -uo pipefail`, so whether an omitted key
# DEGRADES or CRASHES is a per-map decision that has to be written down. Two
# kinds, and the difference is not guessable from the declaration:
#
#   REQUIRED  — TYPE_BIN. It IS the type registry: is_known_type is literally
#               `[[ -n "${TYPE_BIN[$1]+x}" ]]` (lib/validation.sh), and readers
#               loop `${!TYPE_BIN[@]}`. A type absent here does not exist, so
#               bare reads are correct by construction.
#   OPTIONAL  — everything else (TYPE_CHANNELS, TYPE_AUTH, TYPE_INSTALL,
#               TYPE_API_FILE, TYPE_API_VAR, TYPE_PROBE, TYPE_SKILLS_DIR).
#               Omission is a MEANINGFUL signal with a documented default, so
#               every reader MUST supply it: `${TYPE_X[$type]:-<default>}`.
#               A bare read turns a supported state into an unbound-variable
#               crash that names the ARRAY and not the type — which is exactly
#               the bug DIVE-2076 fixed in five readers, and DIVE-2076's sweep
#               found again in cmd_auth_set, where the crash pre-empted a
#               graceful `fail` written for that very case one line below.
#
# Registering a new type: add TYPE_BIN (mandatory) and then decide each optional
# map explicitly. Prefer an explicit entry over relying on the default — write
# `[newtype]=0` in TYPE_CHANNELS rather than omitting it, so the intent is
# reviewable. tests/type_map_registration_contract_unit.sh enforces both halves:
# every optional-map reader carries a default, and TYPE_BIN keys are covered.

  # box and selects it, forcing the npm install -g to land in v24's real bin
  # dir even when the `v24` alias has drifted (same drift the nightly
  # soft-updates hit — DIVE-1189). We then one-hop-symlink the just-installed
  # codex into ~/.local/bin (where TYPE_BIN[codex] and the agent unit's PATH
  # look). We resolve its real path as `$(npm prefix -g)/bin/codex` — NOT
  # `command -v codex`, which can land on a stray /usr/bin/codex, and NOT
  # `dirname $(nvm which 24)`, which is what this recipe used until DIVE-2596.
  #
  # DIVE-2596: `nvm which 24` and `npm prefix -g` are NOT the same directory,
  # and the comment that used to sit here asserted they were ("== `npm prefix
  # -g`/bin, so the symlink is guaranteed to point at the codex we just
  # installed"). They are two different questions:
  #   nvm which 24  — which node did nvm SELECT   (an intent)
  #   npm prefix -g — which node is RUNNING npm   (the outcome of this install)
  # They diverge because ~/.local/bin precedes nvm's bin dir on PATH and holds a
  # `node` symlink planted by the openclaw recipe below, pinned at whatever
  # `nvm which 24` meant on the day openclaw was last installed. npm is a
  # `#!/usr/bin/env node` script, so nvm's npm gets EXECUTED BY that pinned
  # node, and `npm prefix -g` (derived from process.execPath) reports the
  # pinned node's prefix — which is where `npm install -g` then puts the
  # binary. `nvm use` cannot correct this: it edits PATH, and the shadow is
  # EARLIER on PATH. Measured on the 5dive host: nvm which 24 -> v24.19.0,
  # npm prefix -g -> v24.18.0, codex under v24.18.0/bin, symlink dangling,
  # create aborting with "install reported success but bin still missing" on a
  # box where codex works fine.
  #
  # `npm prefix -g` is immune by construction: the same npm process answers the
  # locator query and performs the install, so target and outcome cannot
  # disagree. Mirrors openclaw below, which already derives its target this way.
  # Note we do NOT copy openclaw's `nvm use 24 --silent`: measured on the host,
  # it does not move `npm prefix -g` (the shadow is earlier on PATH than
  # anything `nvm use` edits), and tests/codex_install_node24_unit.sh forbids
  # the substring outright because `nvm use` alone cannot provision a fresh box
  # (DIVE-1329). Adding it would buy nothing and cost that guard.
  #
  # `nvm install 24` also resolves 24 against the REMOTE, so it downloads and
  # installs a brand-new v24 whenever upstream cuts one — which is what makes
  # `nvm which 24` move out from under a box that has not changed. That is why
  # the -x short-circuit stays FIRST: an already-installed codex must not drag
  # a node download onto every create.
  #
  # The trailing `-x` assert is the second half of the fix: a dangling symlink
  # now fails the recipe with an honest rc instead of being reported as a
  # successful install and re-diagnosed downstream (cmd_auth.sh) as a missing
  # binary, which is a true statement about the wrong object — codex IS
  # installed; the LOCATOR was wrong.
  # DIVE-1189: `5dive agent install codex --upgrade` sets FORCE_INSTALL=1 to skip

#      break openclaw (wrong wire format). The two override tables are deliberately
#      NOT shared for this reason.
#   2. z.ai exposes four endpoint families (zai-global / zai-cn / zai-coding-global
#      / zai-coding-cn). openclaw's `zai-api-key` auto-detect probes the GENERAL
#      endpoints (zai-global, zai-cn) BEFORE the Coding Plan ones, and our create
#      path writes a bare `{provider:zai}` auth profile that never runs that probe
#      — so a GLM Coding-Plan key (which authorizes the *coding* surface) lands on
#      the general endpoint and 401s "authentication failed" (what lodar hit).
#      Pinning models.providers.zai.baseUrl to the coding-global URL selects the

  # So a grep is blind twice over: wrong provider, and wrong spelling of the
  # same model. See DIVE-2607.
  #
  # And hermes has TWO catalogs per provider, which disagree:
  # curated_models_for_provider() prefers a LIVE models.dev/API fetch
  # (provider_model_ids) and falls back to the static _PROVIDER_MODELS only when
  # that fetch fails. `gemini` and `deepseek` are both in _MODELS_DEV_PREFERRED,
  # so the live list is the one that resolves a BYO pin — and it is SMALLER:
  # static deepseek carries deepseek-v4-pro, live carries only chat/reasoner.
  # DIVE-2607 cleared deepseek-v4-pro against the weaker list. So these pins are
  # chosen from the INTERSECTION of live and static: the pin then resolves
  # whichever catalog wins at runtime, including with the network down.

  # what left [openai] and [google] ungraded until DIVE-2631 and [minimax]
  # unpinned until DIVE-3184. The per-provider list is the same static catalog
  # (byte-identical to --all on `anthropic`, and unchanged with the network cut,
  # so it cannot flap).
  #
  # THAT LIST OF THREE IS NOT THE LIST OF OMISSIONS — it is the list of
  # omissions anyone has MEASURED. Four namespaces have ever been checked both
  # ways and three of the four were missing from --all (anthropic 9/9 diff-clean;
  # openai 20/0; google 7/0; minimax 3/0). The other 16 namespaces --all reports,
  # and any it hides that nobody has thought to ask about, are unmeasured in this
  # direction — and you cannot use --all to discover what --all is hiding. So the
  # rule takes no exceptions and needs no reasoning about which namespaces are
  # safe: use --provider, every time. It costs the same (DIVE-3183).

  # And do NOT settle one of these against a DIFFERENT tool's catalog: models.dev
  # — which hermes itself prefers at runtime — lists both the old openai/gpt-4o

  # have cleared two genuinely stale pins. Only the list that resolves the pin
  # has authority over it (DIVE-2631).

  # retired upstream. Google's own v1beta still serves gemini-2.0-flash (50
  # models, HTTP 200, queried with our key by main 2026-08-03), and models.dev
  # still lists gpt-4o. A pin is wrong here when the list that RESOLVES it does
  # not carry it, which is a property of the vendor agent's catalog, not of the
  # model's lifecycle. Write it that way in any future ticket or commit: "absent
  # from <the resolving list>, still present at <upstream>" — never "the vendor
  # dropped it". The two get fixed differently and only one of them is our bug.
  #
  # Measured on openclaw 2026.7.1-2: openai carries no gpt-4 family at all (20
  # ids, starting at gpt-5.3), google carries only 2.5.x/3.x (7 ids), moonshot
  # only k2.6 / k2.7-code, deepseek only chat / reasoner (DIVE-2628, DIVE-2631).
  # minimax carries 3 ids — MiniMax-M2.7, -M2.7-highspeed, M3 — graded on
  # 2026.7.1-2 (0790d9f) with anthropic=9 as the non-vacuity control; M2.7 is the

# --- Claude (Claude Code) harness BYO custom-provider catalog -----------------
# The claude harness can be pointed at any third-party provider that ships an
# Anthropic Messages-API-compatible endpoint by overriding ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL +
# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and the per-tier model ids (the modern Claude Code knobs
# ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL — so whichever tier the agent
# selects, and the background haiku tasks, map to a model the provider actually
# serves instead of 404-ing on "claude-…"). Listed endpoints are VERIFIED, not
# necessarily vendor-DOCUMENTED — and the distinction is load-bearing, so do not
# "tidy" it back. Verified means: the route answers (401 for absent/invalid
# credentials, NOT 404 — a nonsense sibling path on the same host does return a
# real url.not_found body, which is what makes the 401 mean something) and a
# discriminating auth layer runs behind it (absent vs invalid credentials give
# different messages AND different error types).
#   moonshot is REAL BUT UNDOCUMENTED, measured 2026-07-28 (DIVE-2246). Moonshot's
# own docs describe an OpenAI-compatible API only — no `anthropic`, no `messages`,
# no ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL anywhere — yet api.moonshot.ai/anthropic answers exactly as
# above. A MISSING DOC PAGE IS NOT A MISSING ENDPOINT.
#   This comment previously said "only providers with a DOCUMENTED anthropic-compat
# endpoint are listed", which the table below it violated. That is worse than no
# comment: an auditor applying the stated rule finds moonshot backed by no vendor
# doc and DELETES A WORKING PROVIDER. If you add an entry here, verify the route
# yourself and say so — do not go looking for a doc page to justify it.
# The rest of BYO_PROVIDER_LABEL is intentionally absent (no compat path at all →
# would break the harness). Model
# ids drift upstream — operators can override per agent via the model picker, or
# we bump these. Values verified against vendor Claude-Code docs 2026-06-03.
# OpenRouter (DIVE-1100): OpenRouter ships a NATIVE Anthropic-skin endpoint at
# https://openrouter.ai/api (Claude Code appends /v1/messages), so the harness
# talks to it directly — no translation proxy. The OpenRouter key rides
# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (sk-or-…) and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be empty; both are
# already handled by _apply_byo_claude. NOTE: OpenRouter's Anthropic endpoint
# TRANSLATES — it accepts any OpenRouter model slug (openai/*, google/*, z-ai/*,
# deepseek/*, meta-llama/*) in Anthropic wire format and converts it, verified
# 2026-07-10 including a real headless Claude Code turn on z-ai/glm-4.6. The
# "openrouter/auto" alias does NOT resolve here (it's an OpenAI-format router
# convenience, not a real model), so we pin concrete per-tier defaults to
# anthropic/* as a SAFE DEFAULT — operators override any tier via
# `agent create --model=<slug>` or `agent config set model=<slug>` (DIVE-1103).
# Slugs verified against the LIVE openrouter.ai /api/v1/models list 2026-07-25
# (DIVE-1897). Verified present: anthropic/claude-opus-5, anthropic/claude-sonnet-5,
# anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5, openrouter/auto. NOTE haiku is deliberately NOT bumped:
# there is no claude-haiku-5 on OpenRouter, 4.5 is the current haiku. NOTE the opus
# slot was the only stale entry — its sibling sonnet was already at 5, so one tier had
# been bumped and the other had not.
# Qwen / Alibaba Model Studio (DIVE-2756): verified LIVE with a real Token Plan key
# 2026-08-07 — not doc-and-probe-only like the pre-ship research. A full /v1/messages
# POST to token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/apps/anthropic returned 200 with
# a real completion, and a claude-type agent ran qwen3.8-max through this exact env
# shape for hours the same day. BEWARE THE KEY-SPACE SPLIT: Alibaba serves TWO
# credential families that do NOT interchange. Token Plan (subscription) keys auth
# ONLY on token-plan.<region>.maas.aliyuncs.com; pay-as-you-go Model Studio keys auth
# on dashscope[-intl|-us].aliyuncs.com. Measured 2026-08-07 with the same key across
# all three hosts: 200 on token-plan, `403 {"message":"invalid api-key"}` on both
# dashscope hosts — a discriminating auth layer rejecting a FOREIGN key, which is what
# makes the split real rather than a route difference. The tile ships the endpoint it
# was SMOKED on (token-plan); a pay-as-you-go key points at its own host through the
# generic `agent create --base-url` (DIVE-2757) instead of an unsmoked catalog default
# — a tile that 403s for every customer is worse than no tile. Region is part of the
# host (ap-southeast-1); operators on another region override via --base-url the same
# way. Auth rides ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (Bearer) with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY empty — both
# already handled by _apply_byo_claude, same shape as openrouter. Model ids verified
# live the same day: qwen3.8-max answers on opus+sonnet tiers, qwen3.6-flash on the
# haiku tier. No context-cap var is set deliberately: the harness has no per-provider
# context knob, and a wrong one would silently TRUNCATE rather than error (the row's
# open question, resolved as "don't guess"). Region availability re-checked 2026-08-07
# (live probe + vendor confirmation): Token Plan is served ONLY from ap-southeast-1 —
# token-plan.eu-central-1 answers 400 BadRequest.IllegalEndpoint ("Workspace endpoint
# is invalid"), there is no eu-west-1 host, and us-east-1/cn-beijing reject the key
# (separate key namespaces). There is NO EU Token Plan endpoint to switch to for
# latency; EU-based boxes pay the ~170ms RTT to Singapore. Do not re-investigate
# without a new signal (a region added upstream, or a workspace provisioned in it).
